You can divide the world of software into two categories: tools, and workflows. Workflows are your enterprise software, your Jira, and your Salesforce. Tools are your text editors, your git, and your terminal.

Here is a simple way to differentiate between the two:

- Tools are used to create things.
- Workflows are used to manage things.
- Tools are used by creators.
- Workflows are used by managers.
- Tools are used to build.
- Workflows are used to organize.
- ...

The list goes on.

The ultimate goal of a tool is for you to forget that it's there. You should be able to focus on your work, not the tool. The ultimate goal of a workflow is making sure that everyone is on the same page. It's about making sure that everyone is following the same process.

I hate workflows.
I hate them with a passion.
I hate them because they are a necessary evil we use to extract the final bit of productivity from our employees.
I hate them because they are the reason why we have to fill out forms, attend meetings, and write reports.

I love tools.
I love them because they are the reason why we can build amazing things.
I love them because they empower us all to be creators who can get more stuff done in less time.
I love them because they are the reason why we can create art, music, and literature.

Make tools, not workflows.
