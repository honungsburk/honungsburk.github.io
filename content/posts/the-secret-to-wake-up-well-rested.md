I won't drag this out: the secret is to not have an alarm.

Of course, not everyone has the luxury of sleeping without an alarm, but if you're like me and don't have to be at work before 9 AM, give it a try. Sometimes I set an alarm for early meetings or travel, but otherwise, I just make sure to go to sleep around 10-11 PM, winding down with a book and voil√†! I wake up at 7am feeling refreshed.

If you do this, you'll discover two major benefits: you always wake up rested (doh! it's in the title) and you'll likely sleep more efficiently. Sometimes I only need 5-6 hours and wake up at 5 AM. I usually stay in bed for a while until I get motivated to start my day - whether that's watching a movie, working on a programming project, or writing a blog post.

So please do yourself a favor and try turning off your alarm.
