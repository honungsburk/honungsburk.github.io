Hello, history enthusiasts!

I'm thrilled to announce the release of the 3.3 million events version of [timeline](https://timeline.frankhampusweslien.com/)! Dive into world history in a fun and interactive way by guessing the order of historical events.

About 2 months ago, I embarked on this project with the goal of creating an engaging way to learn about the history of the world. You can read more about my initial motivation in my [previous post](@/posts/timeline-trying-to-break-the-internet.md). Since then, I've worked tirelessly to add new features and improve the game, navigating through numerous challenges and redesigns.

Initially, I experimented with generating events using AI, but the results were inconsistent. My second attempt involved using the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint, which proved limited. Finally, inspired by [Wikitrivia](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/), I downloaded events directly from Wikidata, allowing me to extract a staggering 3.3 million events!

While my game shares similarities with Wikitrivia, there are key differences. Wikitrivia has a limited number of events and lacks a tagging system. To address this, I introduced tags and year ranges, enabling players to filter events and create a more personalized experience.

My greatest achievement with this project is staying true to my vision: creating a fun and interactive way to learn about world history. I'm incredibly proud of the final product and hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Play [timeline](https://timeline.frankhampusweslien.com/) and let me know your thoughts. Happy learning!
