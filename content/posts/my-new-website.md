Hello, people of the internet!

This is the third iteration of my website.
I wanted to put a larger focus on my open-source contributions so there is now
a [projects](/projects) tab. You'll find all the NFTs I minted and sold in 2021 at
[https://nft.frankhampusweslien.com/](https://nft.frankhampusweslien.com/)

/Cheers
