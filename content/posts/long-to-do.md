When I was young, I played the guitar—or at least, I tried to.
I dreamed of being a rock star, but I didn't want to practice.
Without putting in the necessary time and effort, I was a terrible student who made little progress.
I was too focused on the end goal rather than enjoying the journey.

Fast forward to my twenties, and I decided to learn how to paint.
This time, I approached things differently.
I dedicated a significant amount of time to practice, but more importantly,
I shifted my focus from the end result to the process itself.
By concentrating on the act of painting rather than worrying about becoming a great painter, I improved rapidly.
With each brushstroke, I learned something new, and my skills grew.
It didn’t take long before I exceeded my own expectations. It felt amazing.

Of course, this is only one part of the puzzle.
You also need to incorporate [deliberate practice](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice>).
I drilled the basics, like drawing boxes and doing studies, over and over again.
Boring? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely.

But here's the thing: to stay motivated enough to do all that repetitive, often boring work, you have to focus on the process.
If you want to learn to paint—or pursue any creative endeavor—you must learn to enjoy the journey, not just the destination.
As you gain skill, activities like painting, dancing, or playing music become more enjoyable because you can create more complex and interesting things.
However, the core of what you're doing remains the same.
Whether you're a beginner or a master, you still sit down with your brushes, mix your paints, and apply them to the canvas.
The process is 99% the same, regardless of your level of skill.

So, if you're serious about getting good at something, focus on the process.
Long to do, not just to have done. Embrace the repetitive, the mundane, and the challenging parts of the journey.
Love the process, and the end results will follow.
