Oh, simple script upon the page,  
Nothing is easier to engage.  
No bloated app, no fickle style,  
Just truth inscribed in lines worthwhile.

Markdown dances, clean and bright,  
Her syntax shaped by God's light.  
Headers bold, italics lean,  
Asterisks where stars convene.

Inside Obsidianâ€™s boundless vault,  
You do your job without fault.  
No tangled chains of locked-in lore,  
Just knowledge free forevermore.

And when we make a silly mistake,  
Git is there to pull the brake.  
Undo, revert, reset, amend,  
A safety net that will not bend.

And Grep, the seeker, keen and true,  
Cuts through the jungle, to clear the view.  
A searching blade through tangled vines,  
He spits his truth line by line.

Oh, plaintext with your timeless grace,  
You expand our thoughts into space.  
No walls, no chains, no hidden keys,  
Just letters dancing, wild and free.
