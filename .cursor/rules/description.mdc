This is a personal blog by me, Frank Hampus Weslien. It presents me both
in a personal and professional setting. it uses zola as a static site generator
and is hosted on github pages using a github action that builds and publishes 
it when pushed to master. It uses basic markdown files with frontmatter that
gets turned into HTML pages.

The goal is for me to practice my writing and continously produce interesting
content.
