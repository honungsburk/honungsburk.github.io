When you're new to a codebase, writing code feels like performing surgery. 
You move cautiously, trying to cause minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. 
You develop diagnostic techniques to observe the system's state and measure its health. 
Every change is preceded by careful examination and followed by thorough testing.

But as you master the codebase, coding transforms into sculpting. 
You see the code's potential shape within the existing structure. 
You move pieces around freely, confident in your understanding of how they fit together.
If something breaks, you quickly mend it. The fear is gone, replaced by creative freedom.

The transition from surgeon to sculptor marks a true shift in productivity. It's when you stop asking "What might I break?" and start asking "What could this become?"
