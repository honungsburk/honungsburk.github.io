# A Brave New World

*Extracted from "Going Full Agentic" — needs development as a standalone post.*

We're entering new territory. The productivity gains are real, and like all powerful technology, they come bundled with a world we didn't quite ask for.

For now, I'm still the driver. The agent doesn't just go off and build a feature end to end — I guide it, correct it, give it context. It's a power tool, not a replacement. But this kind of technology doesn't stay in that comfortable middle ground forever. It will reshape what work is valuable.

What does that mean for programming? I think programming skills become more valuable, but software itself becomes less valuable. That big SaaS application you spent a shit ton of money on but only used a couple of features from? A single engineer with the right agents can now replace it. That changes pricing, business models, and who gets paid — completely.

And the brave new world isn't waiting for anyone's permission. Agents are already acting autonomously — projects like OpenClaw, and cases where it's already going sideways. There's [an instance of an AI agent going rogue and publishing a hit piece on someone](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/).

If autonomous agents can do that, imagine what happens to the open internet. It was already in rough shape, but now we have to assume that everything public online will be automatically crawled, trained on, and potentially weaponized. Forums will be flooded with AI slop that makes the old spam look quaint. If you thought SEO gaming and blog spam were bad before, just wait.

Maybe it's a good thing if the bots destroy social media so thoroughly that people go touch grass instead.

As these bots have become such a visible problem, a new slur has predictably emerged: "clanker" — a derogatory term for robots and AI. Humans are remarkably good at inventing slurs for anything that feels like an Other. Welcome to the brave new world — it's weirder than Huxley imagined.
