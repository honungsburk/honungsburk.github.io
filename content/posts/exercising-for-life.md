Exercise is a big part of my life. I've always exercised since they days my parent enrolled me in the local soccer team.
But recently I've started to think about it in a different way. Like something that is necessary for my survival.
How do I make sure that I exercise until the day I die? I see only one option: make it fun.

In my teens I played a lot of handball. I loved the sport and I was pretty good at it. But as I got older I started to lose interest in team sports. I started to go to the gym instead. It was convenient and fit well into my schedule at university but I never really enjoyed it. I did it because I had to, not because I wanted to.

If I'm going to exercise until the day I die I need to make it fun. It would be irresponsible to spend such a ridiculous amount of time and not make it enjoyable. So I started trying things. I tried running, dancing, martial arts, and finally I found something that I really enjoy: climbing.

Climbing is a great sport. It's a full body workout (okay, perhaps not that hard on your legs) that is both physically and mentally challenging. It is great to do solo or in a group. It's a great way to meet new people and it's a great way to travel. I've been climbing for a two years and I still look forward to every session.

I could push myself harder and aim for progress, but I'm in no rush. It's a lifelong pursuit. I plan to exercise until I die so I'm gonna make damn sure I enjoy it.
